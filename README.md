# UselesTec

This was a school project made in the first semester of my second year at uni. It's a web page made to mimic an online tech store and
it is meant to display as many front-end programming techniques as possible. It is not polished and may have ceratin bugs or 
useless features (hence the name). It served its purpose which was to show an understanding of code.

The website was never meant for commercial use.
